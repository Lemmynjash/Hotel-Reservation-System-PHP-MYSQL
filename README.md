# Hotel-Reservation-System-PHP-MYSQL
A MySQL-PHP based hotel reservation system  I have created a Hotel Reservation system, which can be used by the Hotel clients to make reservations. We provide the Hotel clients and administration with a browser based system which can be deployed on a server to make reservations.  The project makes use of a MySQL Database, Apache Server, PHP, HTML and CSS. The system makes use of MySQL to store the user information, Apache server to host the database, PHP to query the database, and HTML/CSS for creating a user friendly interface. Since we have used a MySQL database, the project doesnâ€™t face concurrency problems, and multiple terminals can be used at once to book rooms.
